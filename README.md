# steward

Steward is a Command & Control backend system for Servers, IOT and Edge platforms where the network link for reaching them can be reliable like local networks, or totally unreliable like satellite links. An end node can even be offline when you give it a command, and Steward will make sure that the command is delivered when the node comes online.

Example use cases:

- Send a specific message to one or many end nodes that will instruct to run scripts or a series of shell commands to change config, restart services and control those systems.
- Gather IOT/OT data from both secure and not secure devices and systems, and transfer them encrypted in a secure way over the internet to your central system for handling those data.
- Collect metrics or monitor end nodes and store the result on a central Steward instance, or pass those data on to another central system for handling metrics or monitoring data.
- Distribute certificates.

As long as you can do something as an operator on in a shell on a system you can do the same with Steward in a secure way to one or all end nodes (servers) in one go with one single message/command.

**NB** Expect the main branch to have breaking changes. If stability is needed, use the released packages, and read the release notes where changes will be explained.

## What is it ?

Command And Control anything like Servers, Containers, VM's or others by creating and sending messages with methods who will describe what to do. Steward will then take the responsibility for making sure that the message are delivered to the receiver, and that the method specified are executed with the given parameters defined. An example of a message.

An example of a **request method** to feed into the system. All fields are explained in detail further down in the document.

```json
[
    {
        "directory":"/var/cli/command_result/",
        "fileName": "some-file-name.result",
        "toNode": "ship1",
        "method":"REQCliCommand",
        "methodArgs": ["bash","-c","sleep 5 & tree ./"],
        "replyMethod":"REQToFileAppend",
        "ACKTimeout":5,
        "retries":3,
        "replyACKTimeout":5,
        "replyRetries":3,
        "methodTimeout": 10
    }
]
```

If the receiver `toNode` is down when the message was sent, it will be **retried** until delivered within the criterias set for `timeouts` and `retries`. The state of each message processed is handled by the owning steward instance where the message originated, and no state about the messages are stored in the NATS message broker.

Since the initial connection from a Steward node is outbound towards the central NATS message broker no inbound firewall openings are needed.

## Disclaimer

All code in this repository are to be concidered not-production-ready, and the use is at your own responsibility and risk. The code are the attempt to concretize the idea of a purely async management system where the controlling unit is decoupled from the receiving unit, and that that we know the state of all the receiving units at all times.

Also read the license file for further details.

Expect the main branch to have breaking changes. If stability is needed, use the released packages, and read the release notes where changes will be explained.

## Overview

Send Commands with Request Methods to control your servers by passing a messages that will have guaranteed delivery  based on the criteries set, and when/if the receiving node is available. The result of the method executed will be delivered back to you from the node you sent it from.

Steward uses **NATS** as message passing architecture for the commands back and forth from nodes. Delivery is guaranteed within the criterias set. All of the processes in the system are running concurrently, so if something breaks or some process is slow it will not affect the handling and delivery of the other messages in the system.

A node can be a server running any host operating system, a container living in the cloud somewhere, a Rapsberry Pi, or something else that needs to be controlled that have an operating system installed.

Steward can be compiled to run on all major architectures like **x86**, **amd64**,**arm64**, **ppc64** and more, with for example operating systems like **Linux**, **OSX**, **Windows**.

## Inspiration

The idea for how to handle processes, messages and errors are based on Joe Armstrongs idea behind Erlang described in his Thesis <https://erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf>.

Joe's document describes how to build a system where everything is based on sending messages back and forth between processes in Erlang, and where everything is done concurrently.

I used those ideas as inspiration for building a fully concurrent system to control servers or container based systems by passing  messages between processes asynchronously to execute methods, handle errors, or handle the retrying if something fails.

Steward is written in the programming language Go with NATS as the message broker.

## Why

With existing solutions there is often either a push or a pull kind of setup to control the nodes.

In a push setup the commands to be executed is pushed to the receiver, but if a command fails because for example a broken network link it is up to you as an administrator to detect those failures and retry them at a later time until it is executed successfully.

In a pull setup an agent is installed at the Edge unit, and the configuration or commands to execute locally are pulled from a central repository. With this kind of setup you can be pretty certain that sometime in the future the node will reach it's desired state, but you don't know when. And if you want to know the current state you will need to have some second service which gives you that information.

In it's simplest form the idea about using an event driven system as the core for management of Edge units is that the sender/publisher are fully decoupled from the receiver/subscriber. We can get an acknowledge message if a message is received or not, and with this functionality we will at all times know the current state of the receiving end.

## Publishing and Subscribing processes

All parts of the system like processes, method handlers, messages, error handling are running concurrently.

If one process hangs on a long running message method it will not affect the rest of the system.

### Publisher

1. A message in valid format is appended to the in socket.
1. The message is picked up by the system and put on a FIFO ringbuffer.
1. The method type of the message is checked, a subject is created based on the content of the message,  and a publisher process to handle the message type for that specific receiving node is started if it does not exist.
1. The message is then serialized to binary format, and sent to the subscriber on the receiving node.
1. If the message is expected to be ACK'ed by the subcriber then the publisher will wait for an ACK if the message was delivered. If an ACK was not received within the defined timeout the message will be resent. The amount of retries are defined within the message.

### Subscriber

1. The receiving end will need to have a subscriber process started on a specific subject and be allowed handle messages from the sending nodes to execute the method defined in the message.
2. When a message have been received, a handler for the method type specified in the message will be executed.
3. If the output of the method called is supposed to be returned to the publiser it will do so by using the replyMethod specified.

### Load balancing

Steward instances with the same **Nodename** will automatically load balance the handling of messages on a given subject, and any given message will only be handled once by one instance.

### Logical structure

TODO: Make a diagram here...

## Terminology

- **Node**: Something with an operating system that have network available. This can be a server, a cloud instance, a container, or other.
- **Process**: A message handler that knows how to handle messages of a given subject concurrently.
- **Message**: A message sent from one Steward node to another.

## Features

### Error messages from nodes

- Error messages will be sent back to the central error handler upon failure on a node.

```log
Tue Sep 21 09:17:55 2021, info: toNode: ship2, fromNode: central, method: REQOpProcessList: max retries reached, check if node is up and running and if it got a subscriber for the given REQ type
```

### Message handling and threads

- The handling of all messages is done by spawning up a process for handling the message in it's own thread. This allows us to down on the **individual message level** keep the state for each message both in regards to ACK's, error handling, send retries, and rerun of a method for a message if the first run was not successful.

- Processes for handling messages on a host can be **restarted** upon **failure**, or asked to just terminate and send a message back to the operator that something have gone seriously wrong. This is right now just partially implemented to test that the concept works, where the error action is  **action=no-action**.

- Publisher Processes on a node for handling new messages for new nodes will automatically be spawned when needed if it does not already exist.

- Messages not fully processed or not started yet will be automatically rehandled if the service is restarted since the current state of all the messages being processed are stored on the local node in a **key value store** until they are finished.

- All messages processed by a publisher will be written to a log file after they are processed, with all the information needed to recreate the same message if needed, or it can be used for auditing.

- All handling down to the process and message level are handled concurrently. So if there are problems handling one message sent to a node on a subject it will not affect the messages being sent to other nodes, or other messages sent on other subjects to the same host.

- Message types of both **ACK** and **NACK**, so we can decide if we want or don't want an Acknowledge if a message was delivered succesfully.
Example: We probably want an **ACK** when sending some **REQCLICommand** to be executed, but we don't care for an acknowledge **NACK** when we send an **REQHello** event.

### Timeouts and retries for requests

- Default timeouts to wait for ACK messages and max attempts to retry sending a message are specified upon startup. This can be overridden on the message level.

- Timeouts can be specified on both the **message**, and the **method**.
  - A message can have a timeout used for used for when to resend and how many retries.
  - If the method triggers a shell command, the command can have its own timeout, allowing process timeout for long/stuck commands, or for telling how long the command is supposed to run.

Example of a message with timeouts set:

```json
[
    {
        "directory":"/some/result/directory/",
        "fileName":"my-syslog.log",
        "toNode": "ship2",
        "methodArgs": ["bash","-c","tail -f /var/log/syslog"],
        "replyMethod":"REQToFileAppend",
        "method":"REQCliCommandCont",
        "ACKTimeout":3,
        "retries":3,
        "methodTimeout": 60
    }
]
```

In the above example, the values set meaning:

- **ACKTimeout** : Wait 3 seconds for an **ACK** message.
- **retries** : If an **ACK** is not received, retry sending the message 3 times.
- **methodTimeout** : Let the bash command `tail -f ./tmp.log` run for 60 seconds before it is terminated.

If no timeout are specified in a message the defaults specified in the **etc/config.yaml** are used.

#### REQRelay

Instead of injecting the new Requests on the central server, you can relay messages via another node as long as the nats-server authorization conf permits it. This is what REQRelay is for.

This functionality can be thought of as attaching a terminal to a Steward instance. Instead of injecting messages directly on for example the central Steward instance you can use another Steward instance and relay messages via the central instance.

Example configuration of relay authorization for nats-server can be found in the [doc folder](doc/).

Example:

```json
[
    {
        "directory":"/var/tail-logs/",
        "fileName": "my-wifi.log",
        "toNode": "node1",
        "relayViaNode": "central",
        "relayReplyMethod": "REQToConsole",
        "methodArgs": ["bash","-c","tail -f /var/log/wifi.log"],
        "method":"REQCliCommandCont",
        "replyMethod":"REQToFileAppend",
        "ACKTimeout":5,
        "retries":3,
        "replyACKTimeout":5,
        "replyRetries":3,
        "methodTimeout": 10
    }
]
```

```text
                    1                           2                           3       
             ┌─────────────┐             ┌─────────────┐             ┌─────────────┐
------------▷│             │------------▷│             │------------▷│             │
             │   node1     │             │   central   │             │ node2       │
◁------------│             │◁------------│             │◁------------│             │
             └─────────────┘             └─────────────┘             └─────────────┘
                    6                           5                           4       
```

Steps Explained:

##### Relay Step 1

- The **relayViaNode** field of the message is checked, and If set the message will be encapsulated within a **REQRelayInitial** message where the original message field values are kept, and put back on the message queue on **node1**.
- The new **REQRelayInitial** message will again be picked up on **node1** and handled by the **REQRelayInitial handler**.
- The **REQRelayInitial handler** will set the message method to **REQRelay**, and forward the message to the node value in the **relayViaNode** field.

##### Relay Step 2

- On **central** the **REQRelay method handler** will recreate the **original** message, and forward it to **node2**.

##### Relay Step 3

- **Node2** receives the request, and executes the **original** method with the arguments specified.

##### Relay Step 4

- The result is sent back to **central** in the form of a normal reply message.

##### Relay Step 5

- When the **reply** message is received on central a copy of the **reply** message will be created , and forwarded to **node1** where it originated.
- The the **original reply method** `"replyMethod":"REQToFileAppend"` is handled on central.

##### Relay Step 6

- On **node1** the **relayReplyMethod** is checked for how to handle the message. In this case it is printed to the consoles STDOUT.

### Flags and configuration file

Steward supports both the use of flags with values set at startup, and the use of a config file.

- A default config file will be created at first startup if one does not exist
  - The default config will contain default values.
  - Any value also provided via a flag will also be written to the config file.
- If **Steward** is restarted, the current content of the config file will be used as the new defaults.
  - If you restart Steward without any flags specified, the values of the last run will be read from the config file.
- If new values are provided via CLI flags, they will take **precedence** over the ones currently in the config file.
  - The new CLI flag values will be written to the config, making it the default for the next restart.
- The config file can be edited directly, removing the need for CLI flag use.
- To create a default config, simply:
    1. Remove the current config file (or move it).
    2. Restart Steward. A new default config file, with default values, will be created.

### Schema for the messages to send into Steward via the API's

- toNode : `string`
- toNodes : `string array`
- method : `string`
- methodArgs : `string array`
- replyMethod : `string`
- replyMethodArgs : `string array`
- ACKTimeout : `int`
- retries : `int`
- replyACKTimeout : `int`
- replyRetries : `int`
- methodTimeout : `int`
- replyMethodTimeout : `int`
- directory : `string`
- fileName : `string`
- RelayViaNode: `string`
- RelayReplyMethod: `string`

### Nats messaging timeouts

The various timeouts for the Nats messages can be controlled via the configuration file or flags.

If the network media is a high latency. satellite links it will make sense to adjust the client timeout to reflect the latency

```text
  -natsConnOptTimeout int
        default nats client conn timeout in seconds (default 20)
```

The interval in seconds the nats client should try to reconnect to the nats-server if the connection is lost.

```text
  -natsConnectRetryInterval int
        default nats retry connect interval in seconds. (default 10)
```

Jitter values.

```text
  -natsReconnectJitter int
        default nats ReconnectJitter interval in milliseconds. (default 100)
  -natsReconnectJitterTLS int
        default nats ReconnectJitterTLS interval in seconds. (default 5)
```

### Compression of the Nats message payload

You can choose to enable compression of the payload in the Nats messages.

```text
  -compression string
        compression method to use. defaults to no compression, z = zstd, g = gzip. Undefined value will default to no compression
```

When starting a Steward instance with compression enabled it is the publishing of the message payload that is compressed.

The subscribing instance of Steward will automatically detect if the message is compressed or not, and decompress it if needed.

With other words, Steward will by default receive and handle both compressed and uncompressed messages, and you decide on the publishing side if you want to enable compression or not.

### Serialization of messages sent between nodes

Steward support two serialization formats when sending messages. By default it uses the Go spesific **GOB** format, but serialization with **CBOR** are also supported.

A benefit of using **CBOR** is the size of the messages when transferred.

To enable **CBOR** serialization either start **steward** by setting the serialization flag:

```bash
./steward -serialization="cbor" <other flags here...>
```

Or edit the config file `<steward directory>/etc/config.toml` and set:

```toml
Serialization = "cbor"
```

### startup folder

#### General functionality

Messages can be automatically scheduled to be read and executed at startup of Steward.

A folder named **startup** will be present in the working directory of Steward, and you put the messages to be executed at startup here.

Messages put in the startup folder will not be sent to the broker but handled locally, and only (eventually) the reply message from the Request Method called will be sent to the broker.

#### How to send the reply to another node

Normally the **fromNode** field is automatically filled in with the node name of the node where a message originated.

Since messages within the startup folder is not received from another node via the normal message path we need to specify the **fromNode** field within the message for where we want the reply delivered.

#### method timeout

We can also make the request method run for as long as the Steward instance itself is running. We can do that by setting the **methodTimeout** field to a value of `-1`.

This can make sense if you for example wan't to continously ping a host, or continously run a script on a node.

##### Example

```json
[
    {
        "toNode": "ship1",
        "fromNode": "central",
        "method": "REQCliCommandCont",
        "methodArgs": [
            "bash",
            "-c",
            "nc -lk localhost 8888"
        ],
        "replyMethod": "REQToConsole",
        "methodTimeout": 10,
    }
]
```

This message is put in the `./startup` folder on **node1**.</br>
We send the message to ourself, hence specifying ourself in the `toNode` field.</br>
We specify the reply messages with the result to be sent to the console on **central** in the `fromNode` field.</br>
In the example we start a TCP listener on port 8888, and we want the method to run for as long as Steward is running. So we set the **methodTimeout** to `-1`.</br>

### Request Methods

#### REQOpProcessList

Get a list of the running processes.

```json
[
    {
        "directory":"test/dir",

    }
]
```

**NB**: A github issue is filed on not killing all child processes when using pipes <https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23019>. This is relevant for this request type.

And also a new issue registered <https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50436>

TODO: Check in later if there are any progress on the issue. When testing the problem seems to appear when using sudo, or tcpdump without the -l option. So for now, don't use sudo, and remember to use -l with tcpdump
which makes stdout line buffered. `timeout` in front of the bash command can also be used to get around the problem with any command executed.

#### REQTailFile

Tail log files on some node, and get the result for each new line read sent back in a reply message. Uses the methodTimeout to define for how long the command will run.

```json
[
    {
        "directory": "/my/tail/files/",
        "fileName": "tailfile.log",
        "toNode": "ship2",
        "method":"REQTailFile",
        "methodArgs": ["/var/log/system.log"],
        "methodTimeout": 10
    }
]
```

#### REQHttpGet

Scrape web url, and get the html sent back in a reply message. Uses the methodTimeout for how long it will wait for the http get method to return result.

```json
[
    {
        "directory": "web",
        "fileName": "web.html",
        "toNode": "ship2",
        "method":"REQHttpGet",
        "methodArgs": ["https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gchopra/class/public/pages/webdesign/05_simple.html"],
        "replyMethod":"REQToFile",
        "ACKTimeout":10,
        "retries": 3,
        "methodTimeout": 3
    }
]
```

#### REQHttpGetScheduled

Schedule scraping of a web web url, and get the html sent back in a reply message. Uses the methodTimeout for how long it will wait for the http get method to return result.

The **methodArgs** also takes 3 arguments:

  1. The URL to scrape.
  2. The schedule interval given in **seconds**.
  3. How long the scheduler should run in minutes.

The example below will scrape the URL specified every 30 seconds for 10 minutes.

```json
[
    {
        "directory": "web",
        "fileName": "web.html",
        "toNode": "ship2",
        "method":"REQHttpGet",
        "methodArgs": ["https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gchopra/class/public/pages/webdesign/05_simple.html","30","10"],
        "replyMethod":"REQToFile",
        "ACKTimeout":10,
        "retries": 3,
        "methodTimeout": 3
    }
]
```

#### REQHello

Send Hello messages.

All nodes have the flag option to start sending Hello message to the central server. The structure of those messages looks like this.

```json
[
    {
        "toNode": "central",
        "method":"REQHello"
    }
]
```

#### REQCopyFileFrom

Copy a file from one node to another node.

- Source node to copy from is specified in the toNode/toNodes field
- The file to copy and the destination node is specified in the **methodArgs** field:
  1. The first field is the full path of the source file.
  2. The second field is the destination node for where to copy the file to.
  3. The third field is the full path for where to write the copied file.

```json
[
    {
        "directory": "copy",
        "fileName": "copy.log",
        "toNodes": ["central"],
        "method":"REQCopyFileFrom",
        "methodArgs": ["./tmp2.txt","ship2","/tmp/tmp2.txt"],
        "replyMethod":"REQToFileAppend"
    }
]
```

#### REQErrorLog

Method for receiving error logs for Central error logger.

**NB**: This is **not** to be used by users. Use **REQToFileAppend** instead.

### Request Methods used for reply messages

#### REQNone

Don't send a reply message.

An example could be that you send a `REQCliCommand` message to some node, and you specify `replyMethod: REQNone` if you don't care about the resulting output from the original method.

#### REQToConsole

This is a pure replyMethod that can be used to get the data of the reply message printed to stdout where Steward is running.

```json
[
    {
        "directory": "web",
        "fileName": "web.html",
        "toNode": "ship2",
        "method":"REQHttpGet",
        "methodArgs": ["https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gchopra/class/public/pages/webdesign/05_simple.html"],
        "replyMethod":"REQToConsole",
        "ACKTimeout":10,
        "retries": 3,
        "methodTimeout": 3
    }
]
```

#### REQToFileAppend

Append the output of the reply message to a log file specified with the `directory` and `fileName` fields.

```json
[
    {
        "directory":"test/dir",
        "fileName":"test.result",
        "toNode": "ship2",
        "method":"REQOpProcessList",
        "methodArgs": [],
        "replyMethod":"REQToFileAppend",
    }
]
```

#### REQToFile

Write the output of the reply message to a file specified with the `directory` and `fileName` fields, where the writing will write over any existing content of that file.

```json
[
    {
        "directory":"test/dir",
        "fileName":"test.result",
        "toNode": "ship2",
        "method":"REQOpProcessList",
        "methodArgs": [],
        "replyMethod":"REQToFile",
    }
]
```

#### REQToFileNACK

Same as REQToFile, but will not send an ACK when a message is delivered.

#### ReqCliCommand

**ReqCliCommand** is a bit special in that it can be used as both **method** and **replyMethod**

The final result, if any, of the replyMethod will be sent to the central server.

By using the `{{STEWARD_DATA}}` you can grab the output of your initial request method, and then use it as input in your reply method.

**NB:** The echo command in the example below will remove new lines from the data. To also keep any new lines we need to put escaped **quotes** around the template variable. Like this:

- `\"{{STEWARD_DATA}}\"`

Example of usage:

```json
[
    {
        "directory":"cli_command_test",
        "fileName":"cli_command.result",
        "toNode": "ship2",
        "method":"REQCliCommand",
        "methodArgs": ["bash","-c","tree"],
        "replyMethod":"REQCliCommand",
        "replyMethodArgs": ["bash", "-c","echo \"{{STEWARD_DATA}}\" > apekatt.txt"],
        "replyMethodTimeOut": 10,
        "ACKTimeout":3,
        "retries":3,
        "methodTimeout": 10
    }
]
```

Or the same using bash's herestring:

```json
[
    {
        "directory":"cli_command_test",
        "fileName":"cli_command.result",
        "toNode": "ship2",
        "method":"REQCliCommand",
        "methodArgs": ["bash","-c","tree"],
        "replyMethod":"REQCliCommand",
        "replyMethodArgs": ["bash", "-c","cat <<< {{STEWARD_DATA}} > hest.txt"],
        "replyMethodTimeOut": 10,
        "ACKTimeout":3,
        "retries":3,
        "methodTimeout": 10
    }
]
```

### Errors reporting

- Errors happening on **all** nodes will be reported back in to the node name defined with the `-centralNodeName` flag.

### Prometheus metrics

- Prometheus exporters for Metrics.

### Authrization and Key Distribution

#### Key registration on Central Server

All nodes will generate a private and a public key pair. The public key will be sent to the central server as the payload in the **REQHello** messages.

For storing the keys on the central server two databases are involved.

- A Database for all the keys that have not been acknowledge.
- A Database for all the keys that have been acknowledged into the system with a hash of all the keys. This is also the data base that gets distributed out to the nodes when they request and update

1. When a new not already registered key is received on the central server it will be added to the **NO_ACK_DB** database, and a message will be sent to the operator to permit the key to be added to the system.
1. When the operator permits the key, it will be added to the **Acknowledged** database, and the node will be removed from the Not-Acknowledged database.
1. If the key is already in the acked database no changes will be made.

#### Key distribution to nodes

1. Steward nodes will request key updates by sending a message to the central server with the **REQGetKeys** method on a timed interval. The hash of the current keys on a node will be put as the payload of the message.
2. On the Central server the received hash will be compared with the current hash on the central server. If the hashes are equal nothing will be done, and no reply message will be sent back to the end node.
3. If the hashes are not equal a reply message of type **REQKeysDeliverUpdate** will be sent back to the end node with a copy of the acknowledged public keys database and a hash of those keys.
4. The end node will then update it's local key database.

NB: The update process is initiated by the end nodes on a timed interval. No key updates are initiaded from the central server.

### How to Run

#### Run Steward in the simplest possible way for testing

**NB** Running Steward like this is perfect for testing in a local test environment, but is not something you would wan't to do in production.

##### Nats-server

Download the **nats-server** from <https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/releases/>

Or use the curl (replace the version information with wanted version):

`curl -L https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/nats-server-vX.Y.Z-linux-amd64.zip -o nats-server.zip`

Unpack:

`unzip nats-server.zip -d nats-server`

Start the nats server listening on local interfaces and port 4222.

`./nats-server -D`

##### Steward

Steward is written in Go, so you need Go installed to compile it. You can get Go at <https://golang.org/dl/>.

When Go is installed:

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/RaaLabs/steward.git`.

Change directory and build:

```bash
cd ./steward/cmd/steward
go build -o steward
```

Start up a  **central** server which will act as your command and control server.

- `env CONFIG_FOLDER=./etc/ ./steward --nodeName="central" --centralNodeName="central"`

Start up a node that will attach to the **central** node

`env CONFIG_FOLDER=./etc/ ./steward --nodeName="ship1" --centralNodeName="central"` & `./steward --node="ship2"`

You can get all the options with `./steward --help`

Steward will by default create the data and config directories needed in the current folder. This can be changed by using the different flags or editing the config file.

You can also run multiple instances of Steward on the same machine. For testing you can create sub folders for each steward instance, go into each folder and start steward. When starting each Steward instance make sure you give each node a unique `--nodeName`.

##### Send messages with Steward

You can now go to one of the folders for nodes started, and inject messages into the socket file `./tmp/steward.sock` with the **nc** tool.

Example on Mac:

`nc -U ./tmp/steward.sock < reqnone.msg`

Example on Linux:

`nc -NU ./tmp/steward.sock < reqnone.msg`

#### Example for starting steward with some more options set

A complete example to start a central node called `central`.

```bash
env CONFIG_FOLDER=./etc/ ./steward \
 -nodeName="central" \
 -defaultMessageRetries=3 \
 -defaultMessageTimeout=5 \
 -subscribersDataFolder="./data" \
 -centralNodeName="central" \
 -startSubREQErrorLog=true \
 -subscribersDataFolder="./var" \
 -brokerAddress="127.0.0.1:4222"
```

And start another node that will be managed via central.

```bash
env CONFIG_FOLDER=./etc/ ./steward \
 -nodeName="ship1" \ 
 -startPubREQHello=200 \
 -centralNodeName="central" \
 -promHostAndPort=":12112" \
 -brokerAddress="127.0.0.1:4222"
```

**NB**: By default Steward creates it's folders like `./etc`, `./var`, and `./data` in the folder you're in when you start it. If you want to run multiple instances on the same machine you should create separate folders for each instance, and start Steward when you're in that folder. The location of the folders can also be specified within the config file.

#### Nkey Authentication

Nkey's can be used for authentication, and you use the `nkeySeedFile` flag to specify the seed file to use.

Read more in the sections below on how to generate nkey's.

#### nats-server (the message broker)

The broker for messaging is Nats-server from <https://nats.io>. Download, run it, and use the `-brokerAddress` flag on **Steward** to point to the ip and port:

`-brokerAddress="nats://10.0.0.124:4222"`

There is a lot of different variants of how you can setup and confiure Nats. Full mesh, leaf node, TLS, Authentication, and more. You can read more about how to configure the Nats broker called nats-server at <https://nats.io/>.

##### Nats-server config with nkey authentication example

```config
port: 4222
tls {
  cert_file: "some.crt"
  key_file: "some.key"
}


authorization: {
    users = [
        {
            # central
            nkey: <USER_NKEY_HERE>
            permissions: {
                publish: {
      allow: ["some.>","errorCentral.>"]
    }
            subscribe: {
      allow: ["some.>","errorCentral.>"]
    }
            }
        }
        {
            # node1
            nkey: <USER_NKEY_HERE>
            permissions: {
                publish: {
                        allow: ["central.>"]
                }
                subscribe: {
                        allow: ["central.>","some.node1.>","some.node10'.>"]
                }
            }
        }
        {
            # node10
            nkey: <USER_NKEY_HERE>
            permissions: {
                publish: {
                        allow: ["some.node1.>","errorCentral.>"]
                }
                subscribe: {
                        allow: ["central.>"]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The official docs for nkeys can be found here <https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth>.

- Generate private (seed) and public (user) key pair:
  - `nk -gen user -pubout`

- Generate a public (user) key from a private (seed) key file called `seed.txt`.
  - `nk -inkey seed.txt -pubout > user.txt`

More example configurations for the nats-server are located in the [doc](https://github.com/RaaLabs/steward/tree/main/doc) folder in this repository.

### How to send a Message

The API for sending a message from one node to another node is by sending a structured JSON or YAML object into a listener port in of of the following ways.

- unix socket called `steward.sock`. By default lives in the `./tmp` directory
- tcpListener, specify host:port with startup flag, or config file.
- httpListener, specify host:port with startup flag, or config file.

#### Send to socket with netcat

`nc -U ./tmp/steward.sock < myMessage.json`

#### Sending a command from one Node to Another Node

##### Example JSON for appending a message of type command into the `socket` file

In JSON:

```json
[
    {
        "directory":"/var/steward/cli-command/executed-result",
        "fileName": "some.log",
        "toNode": "ship1",
        "method":"REQCliCommand",
        "methodArgs": ["bash","-c","sleep 3 & tree ./"],
        "ACKTimeout":10,
        "retries":3,
        "methodTimeout": 4
    }
]
```

Or in YAML:

```yaml
---
- toNodes:
  - ship1
  method: REQCliCommand
  methodArgs:
  - bash
  - "-c"
  - "
    cat <<< $'[{
    \"directory\": \"metrics\",
    \"fileName\": \"edgeAgent.prom\",
    \"fromNode\":\"metrics\",
    \"toNode\": \"ship1\",
    \"method\":\"REQHttpGetScheduled\",
    \"methodArgs\": [\"http://127.0.0.1:8080/metrics\",
    \"60\",\"5000000\"],\"replyMethod\":\"REQToFile\",
    \"ACKTimeout\":10,
    \"retries\": 3,\"methodTimeout\": 3
    }]'>scrape-metrics.msg
    "
  replyMethod: REQToFile
  ACKTimeout: 5
  retries: 3
  replyACKTimeout: 5
  replyRetries: 3
  methodTimeout: 5
  directory: system
  fileName: system.log
```

##### Specify more messages at once do

        "toNode": "ship2",
        "method":"REQCliCommand",
        "methodArgs": ["bash","-c","sleep 3 & tree ./"],
        "ACKTimeout":10,
        "retries":3,
        "methodTimeout": 4
    }
]
```

##### Send the same message to several hosts by using the toHosts field

```json
[
    {
        "directory": "httpget",
        "fileName": "finn.no.html",
        "toNodes": ["central","ship2"],
        "method":"REQHttpGet",
        "methodArgs": ["https://finn.no"],
        "replyMethod":"REQToFile",
        "ACKTimeout":5,
        "retries":3,
        "methodTimeout": 5
    }
]
```

##### Tail a log file on a node, and save the result of the tail centrally at the directory specified

```json
[
    {
        "directory": "./my/log/files/",
        "fileName": "some.log",
        "toNode": "ship2",
        "method":"REQTailFile",
        "methodArgs": ["./test.log"],
        "ACKTimeout":5,
        "retries":3,
        "methodTimeout": 200
    }
]
```

##### Example for deleting the ringbuffer database and restarting steward

```json
[
    {
        "directory":"system",
        "fileName":"system.log",
        "toNodes": ["ship2"],
        "method":"REQCliCommand",
        "methodArgs": ["bash","-c","rm -rf /usr/local/steward/lib/incomingBuffer.db & systemctl restart steward"],
        "replyMethod":"REQToFileAppend",
        "ACKTimeout":30,
        "retries":1,
        "methodTimeout": 30
    }
]
```

You can save the content to myfile.JSON and append it to the `socket` file:

- `nc -U ./steward.sock < example/toShip1-REQCliCommand.json`

## Concepts/Ideas

### Naming

#### Subject

`<nodename>.<method>.<event>`

Example:

`ship3.REQCliCommand.EventACK`

For ACK messages (using the reply functionality in NATS) we append the `.reply` to the subject.

`ship3.REQCliCommand.EventACK.reply`

**Nodename**: Are the hostname of the device. This do not have to be resolvable via DNS, it is just a unique name for the host to receive the message.

**Event**: Desribes if we want and Acknowledge or No Acknowledge when the message was delivered :

- `EventACK`
- `EventNACK`

Info: The field **Event** are present in both the **Subject** structure and the **Message** structure.
This is due to **Event** being used in both the naming of a subject, and for specifying message type to allow for specific processing of a message.

**Method**: Are the functionality the message provide. Example could be for example `REQCliCommand` or `REQHttpGet`

##### Complete subject example

For Hello Message to a node named "central" of type Event and there is No Ack.

`central.REQHello.EventNACK`

For CliCommand message to a node named "ship1" of type Event and it wants an Ack.

`ship1.REQCliCommand.EventACK`

## TODO

### Add Op option the remove messages from the queue on nodes

If messages have been sent, and not picked up by a node it might make sense to have some method to clear messages on a node. This could either be done by message ID, and/or time duration.
